# UE5 Blueprint Game Prototype Demo: 2D Pixel Card Game

## Overview

This project is a prototype demo built using Unreal Engine 5's Blueprint system. It showcases a 2D pixel art card game with the following key components:

- **Card Data Structure:** Defines the properties and behavior of game cards.
- **Card UI Inspection:** Provides an interface to view and interact with individual cards.
- **2D Map Generation & Navigation Prototypes:** Early implementations for generating 2D maps and navigating within them.

## Features

- **Blueprint-Driven Development:** Entirely implemented with UE5's visual scripting, enabling rapid prototyping.
- **Modular Design:** Separately handles card mechanics with indenpendent data structure tables, making it easy to extend or modify.
